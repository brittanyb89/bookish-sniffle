## Description

The development of this project was inspired by business software that enables employers to keep a roster of team members. Each entered team member's name, role, ID, email address, and other information depending on their role. This generator should simplify entering employee information and make it easier to view current team. This eliminates unorganized paperwork, save time on adding and searching for employee information by saving entered roster into terminal. I learned that the terminal could create and saved information rather than saving information into the local storage.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
